# Android Studio Project
```
	to build Android Game, you shoud create a native project, 
	the `AndroidMainifest.xml CMakeLists.txt build.gradle` files maybe to help you
```


# Assets
```
	you shoud mkdir `kt_assets` in assets
	put the `kite`(engine lua lib) and main.lua, config.lua and other directory(eg: `images`, `fonts`) to `kt_assets` 
	and edit the asset_list.h (every one directory should be one item of ASSERT_DIR)
